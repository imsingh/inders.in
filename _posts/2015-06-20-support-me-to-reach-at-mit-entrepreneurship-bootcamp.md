Hello developers and entrepreneurs. 

I am very happy to announce that my startup idea Ragakosh is selected for MIT Entrepreneurship Bootcamp this year.

The MITx Global Entrepreneurship Bootcamp is a nexus connecting entrepreneurs from around the world to the entrepreneurial ecosystem surrounding the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

To reach at MIT, I need your support. Tuition for Bootcamp is $6000 and other costs are nearly $2000. Please support my Indiegogo Campaign atÂ **<http://igg.me/at/entrepreneurship/x/10537658>** 

Your support will help to transform my idea into reality. 

Thanks.
