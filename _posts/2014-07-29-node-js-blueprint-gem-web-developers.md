Recently I got a copy of Krasimir Tsonev's new Book [Node.js Blueprints](http://www.packtpub.com/nodejs-blueprints/book) by PacketPub.  I started reading book 14 days ago. It was pleasure for me. It helped me in learning lots of things. Apart from Node.js I got glimpses of other JS frameworks Like AngularJS (I am using AngularJS for Long Time), Backbone.js, Ember.js,Socket.io, Express.js, grunt.js,gulp.js to name a few. 

Krasimir's Approach is very lucid. The way he introduces new stuff to reader is very good. Most of all I like the Structure of Book. He introduces the book with design patterns, which surely gonna help new node.js learners. Guiding Intermediate programmers about structure of app in very first chapter is very good idea. When I started learning nodejs the most import issue was building an app with good structure.

Node.js Blueprint is a gem for Web Developers who want to Learn Node.js for Web and Desktop Application. Book has 268 Pages divided in 12 Chapters which covers important things like 

  * Structuring big applications (Chapter 1)
  * developing web apps with express.js and node.js (Chapter 2)
  * using node.js with angular.js (Chapter 3)
  * using socket.io with node.js to create real time apps (Chapter 4)
  * using backbone.js with node.js (Chapter 5)
  * using node.js with ember.js (Chapter 7)
  * Automate Development with Grunt.js and Gulp.js (Chapter 8)
  * focus on test-driven development and (Chapter 9)
  * a neat example of REST API. (Chapter 11)
  * creating Desktop apps with node.js and node-webkit (Chapter 12)
  
For me Chapter 1,4,11 and 12 are bliss. But other chapters are also commendable. It was pleasure to learn how to structure your code.  His introduction to AngularJS is very brief and good and the way he used two databases for blog application with Angular.js and node.js in chapter 3rd is great. Again for me it was new experience to learn socket.io(Chapter 4) and then creating a real chat application with it. Introduction to Desktop development with Node.js and Using REST API are very good. In fact I am almost near to complete Desktop app for my Mobile App [Ragakosh](https://ragakosh.com). I had never written any tests for my application. But know I am using test driven development as integral part of development. 

I would surely recommend this book to every Javascript Developer who wants to learn node.js in good way.
