One of the most important user interface testing issue for web app developer is testing web app on different devices. It is very difficult for a developer to check their web apps on various devices. Because of large variety of android devices, it seems quite difficult. Most of the developer usually check the responsiveness of their app on different devices and platform. 

While developing my web app at http://grubani.inders.in I was required to test web app on different platform. I searched internet for testing solutions and found BrowserStack.

[Browserstack](http://browserstack.com) is paid service on the internet. But it still provides trail plan for checking the service. 

Following are some great features of the BrowserStack.

  * Mobile Browsers : Browserstack provides lots of Mobile Browsers for testing of web apps, which is one the best feature of this service as compare to other services.
