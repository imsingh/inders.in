## Ionic Snippets Plugin for Sublime Text

No Doubt Ionic Framework is one of the best CSS framework out there to be used with Cordova for Hybrid Mobile Application. As a web developer I also started using Ionic with AngularJS and Cordova for creating Mobile Apps. But Soon found that I am using similar code for my apps. So I decided to create a sublime plugin for Ionic Code Snippets. It is very useful for me and lots of other developers have downloaded it. If you are using Sublime Text, follow the instructions to download Plugin to your Sublime text.

  * If Package Control is installed, skip this step. Else, Go to <https://sublime.wbond.net/installation> for Installing Package Control in Sublime Text.
  * Now in Sublime Text Press **Ctrl + Shift + P **and type **Install Package. **Press **Enter.**
  * Now type **Ionic **you will see the plugin there.
  
That's it.
