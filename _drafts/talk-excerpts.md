# Bio

# 1. Thunderplains: Learning RxJS by creating it.

## Abstract
When it comes to Reactive Programming in JavaScript. RxJS is the definite leader. Many developers are really scared to start using RxJS because of all the terminology. In this talk, I will be creating a minimal version of RxJS with a couple of operators to show how RxJS actually works.

## Details
Idea is to create RxJS from scratch in the presentation. I will be doing Live Coding heavily.

Takeaways: It gives better insights into RxJS like:
* Why Observables are Lazy?
* How to create Custom Observables?
* How to create operators?
to name a few.

## Pitch
When I started doing RxJS, there were many things confusing for me. I think this talk will help newcomers to get a jump start using RxJS and it will help intermediate developers to get a deep insight into the topic.

### Why am I qualified?
I am the author of two Ionic books, which are heavily using RxJS. Recently wrote a blog post on Ionic, RxJS, and Angular for Auth0 Blog. I think I have heavily invested myself in RxJS and understand a thing or two about RxJS.
